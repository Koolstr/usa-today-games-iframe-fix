# Fix Window Height of USA Today Games
A very simple script that overrides the height of the iframe used for rendering the window of the games on USA Today's website, preventing the top and bottom from getting cut off as they are currently (at the time of writing).

I made this script for my mother & aunt, both of whom regularly play the games available on USA Today. This resolves the inconvenience they've both been experiencing after USA Today had made some recent changes that broke their own site's layout & formatting. 

## Installation
Add the script to Tampermonkey, or your preferred userscript manager. The script can be found on GreasyFork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/495005-fix-window-height-of-usa-today-games) for ease of installation. Enjoy!
